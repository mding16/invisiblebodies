                However, a “full stack” understanding of labor behind 
                models like word2vec calls for critical consideration

            Coltan is a <a href="https://www.globalissues.org/article/442/guns-money-and-cell-phones" 
            target="_blank">“critical raw mineral in high-tech manufacturing” </a>
            that can be refined to form tantalum, a chemical used to produce 
            tantalum capacitors “that manage the flow of current in 
            electronic devices” like mobile phones, computers, game consoles,
             and camcorders. As of 2014, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) 
             produces 40% of the global coltan supply.

              According to civil society leader Faustin Kantanga, 
              the illicit coltan mines are “rife with prostitution, 
              sexually transmitted diseases and rape” and “those travelling 
              long distances to smuggle coltan are also vulnerable to child 
              traffickers and recruitment by armed groups.” 
               
               <span class="highlight1">
                The coltan supply chain also includes the labor of
